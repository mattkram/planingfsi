## Cautionary Note

I am currently working on releasing this package as open source.
Since this is my first open-source release, the next few releases on PyPi should not be used for production.
I will release version 1.0.0 once I feel that I have sufficiently cleaned up and documented the code. 

## Summary

PlaningFSI is a scientific Python program use to calculate the steady-state response of 2-d marine structures subject to planing flow with consideration for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) as well as rigid body motion.
It was originally written in 2012-2013 to support my Ph.D. research and has recently (2018) been updated and released as open source.

## Required Python version

The code is written in Python and was originally written in Python 2.6.5.
it has since been updated to require Python 3.6+.
Although future versions of Python **should** support, the code, I can make no guarantees.

## Installation

PlaningFSI can be installed with pip:

```
pip install planingfsi
```
