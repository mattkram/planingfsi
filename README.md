# PlaningFSI #

## Summary ##

This project contains the code that I wrote for my Ph.D. research. The program is called "planingFSI" because it is constructed as a means of calculating the steady-state response of 2-d marine structures subject to planing flow with consideration for Fluid-Strucuture Interaction (FSI) as well as rigid body motion.
