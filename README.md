# PlaningFSI #

## Summary ##

This project contains the code that I wrote for my Ph.D. research. The program 
is called "planingFSI" because it is constructed as a means of calculating the 
steady-state response of 2-d marine structures subject to planing flow with 
consideration for Fluid-Strucuture Interaction (FSI) as well as rigid body 
motion.

The code is currently being updated to better match Python conventions (PEP8),
since I was a Python novice when it was originally written.
