# PlaningFSI #

## Summary ##

This project contains the code that I wrote for my Ph.D. research. The program 
calculates the 
steady-state response of 2-d marine structures subject to planing flow with 
consideration for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) as well as rigid body 
motion.

The structures can be either rigid, flexible membranes, or rotational hinged bodies subject to torsional spring constraints. In addition to the option of solving for structural deformation, the code considers the overall equilibrium sinkage and trim of the vessel.

The code is currently being updated to better match Python conventions (PEP8),
since I was a relative Python novice when it was originally written.
